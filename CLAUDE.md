# Project: Claude Project Template Update

> Template upgrade automation with AI-First methodology integration

**Memory:** `.claude/memory/activeContext.md` | **ADR:** `.claude/adr/` | **Branch:** `dev`

## Project-Specific Notes
- Main template: `.claude/` in project root
- New-project template: `.claude/shared/templates/new-project/.claude/`
- BOTH must be updated when making template changes
- Template CLAUDE.md (in shared/templates) should match global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md structure
- Codex CLI integration: `.claude/guides/codex-integration.md` | Skill: `cross-model-review`

## Bridge-stubs for staging sessions
When a Claude Code session's CWD is inside a staging subdir (e.g. `work/dp-notifier/files/v2/`), hook commands like `py -3 .claude/hooks/X.py` resolve relative to that CWD and fail unless a bridge-stub exists at `<staging>/.claude/hooks/X.py`. Stubs re-exec the real hook from the repo root.

**After ANY change to `.claude/settings.json` hook wiring, or after creating a new staging dir, run:**
```
py -3 .claude/scripts/sync-bridge-stubs.py
```
The sync script reads `settings.json`, finds every `.claude/hooks/` dir under `work/`, `deploy/`, `staging/` and ensures each has an up-to-date canonical stub for every hook. Safe idempotent — run any time. Canonical stub: `.claude/scripts/bridge-stub-template.py` (filename-derived, uses `subprocess.run` for Windows path-with-spaces safety).
