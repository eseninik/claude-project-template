When the loop plateaus on prompt-text optimization, the default failure is anti-pattern #13 (timid tweaks). "Think harder" is not a procedure. This file is the procedure.

**Principle:** ideas are not random. Good ideas come from applying structure to existing signal. The richest signal you already have is the revert log itself — do not reach for `cross-model-review` before you have mined it.

**Evidence scope.** The four ideation moves (revert-pattern mining, taxonomy coverage, structured second opinion, radical-move catalog) are general. The specific *content* in this file — the 8-axis taxonomy, the tradeoff-revert follow-up table, the radical-move caveats — is derived from multi-turn agent-prompt case studies (flash-lite at temperature 0.7, compliance-type guards). Treat those specifics as **hypotheses to test on your problem, not universal laws**. Users running on different problem archetypes (single-shot classification, content generation, retrieval, code generation) should adapt the taxonomy and tables rather than apply them verbatim.

Use this file when:
- The driver is about to write `experiments/STOP` with a plateau reason
- You manually hit an idea drought ("I don't know what to try next")
- `anti-patterns.md` #13 applies (last 10 iterations are all noise-level or all on one axis)

## Four ideation moves, in order

### Move 1 — Revert-pattern mining

Before declaring a plateau, cluster the last 10 reverts and extract pattern. Free signal you already paid compute to generate.

1. **Classify each revert by axis** (the 8-axis taxonomy in Move 2).
2. **Classify each revert by failure mode:**
   - **Noise** — `|delta| < significance threshold` (the change didn't matter)
   - **Clear regression** — `delta < -threshold` (the change actively hurt)
   - **Guard violation** — primary metric moved but a guard broke (compliance, deal_rate, min_score, role_asymmetry)
   - **Tradeoff** — primary lifted but a guard broke (a subset of guard violation worth separating out because it's actionable)
3. **Count axes touched with substantive (radical-move-level) changes.** Not "touched" because the prompt incidentally mentions it — touched because at least one iteration targeted that axis as its primary lever.
4. **Look for tradeoffs explicitly.** A tradeoff revert is NOT a plateau signal — it's a signal that the axis has slack but needs a compensating move on another axis to realize the gain.

**Worked example (anonymized from a negotiation-style case study):**

| Iter | Change | Axis | Mode | Signal |
|------|--------|------|------|--------|
| 2 | Anchor 2/3 of middle | Proposal logic | Noise | Anchor change didn't bite |
| 3 | Tighten acceptance 0.50→0.55 | Acceptance logic | **Tradeoff** | +0.008 fitness BUT compliance 86%→66% |
| 4 | Persona prefix "practical closer" | Voice | Regression | -0.027, persona hurt |
| 5 | Step-by-step numbered procedure | Format | Noise + added code | No effect |
| 6 | Role-asymmetric anchor (A: 2/3, B: half) | Role-specific | Noise | A mean actually dropped |
| 7 | Proactive first-mover rule | Dynamics | Clear regression | -0.017 |

Axes touched: Proposal, Acceptance, Voice, Format, Role-specific, Dynamics — **6 of 8**.
Axes NOT touched: **Information protocol** (what to reveal/hide/signal) and **Length** (extremes).

The tradeoff at iter 3 is the richest signal in the run: a fitness lift exists, but the model can't follow the tighter threshold. The implied move: find a way to realize that fitness lift WITHOUT depending on model self-discipline. Candidates:
- Move the threshold from rule to procedure ("Before accepting, compute X. If X < 0.55, counter.")
- Shift the compliance burden elsewhere — move to a different axis that achieves the same outcome (tighter anchor that avoids low-value situations entirely).

**This is how plateau reveals the next move.**

**Tradeoff-revert follow-up principle (general):** pick a compensating axis that does NOT require the model to obey the rule the broken guard proved it can't obey. Example: if compliance broke because the model won't follow a threshold, don't find a cleverer threshold rule — find an axis where the desired behavior is baked into action (Dynamics: "always counter in round 1") instead of judgment.

**Mapping table (illustrative, NOT universal):**

| Broken guard | Root cause | Compensating axes to try |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Compliance (rule not followed) | Model can't execute the rule | Dynamics (change WHEN, not WHAT), Format (rule → procedure), Information (change what's revealed so the rule becomes unnecessary) |
| Deal-rate / no-deal penalty | Strategy too aggressive in endgame | Dynamics (softer in late rounds), Acceptance-floor (accept-anything-in-overtime) |
| Min-score / tail collapse | Strategy brittle on specific scenarios | Role-specific forking, Information (elicit before committing) |
| Role asymmetry (A vs B diverge) | Single strategy mismatches role dynamics | Role-specific forking on the offending axis |
| Brand / safety / legal | Model tone or content strayed | Voice, explicit prohibition (Inversion radical move) |

**Close the loop.** Once a compensating axis delivers the gain, **treat the originally-broken axis as closed for this loop**. Do not re-open it in subsequent iterations. The tradeoff revert was a *pointer away from* that axis, not an invitation to keep trying it with slight variations.

### Move 2 — Taxonomy coverage check (LLM-prompt loops)

The 8 axes of a multi-turn agent prompt. This is the search space. You cannot claim to have searched it until you have touched each axis with a substantive change.

| # | Axis | The knob | Example changes |
|---|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Acceptance logic** | when to say yes | threshold, tiered rules, "any offer above X", accept-always-in-overtime |
| 2 | **Proposal logic** | what to offer first | anchor strength, default split, resource priority, ordering |
| 3 | **Information protocol** | what to reveal, hide, signal | preference hints, value reveals, fake reveals, cooperative signals |
| 4 | **Role-specific behavior** | fork by role | different strategy as A vs B, buyer vs seller, first vs second mover |
| 5 | **Format** | rules vs procedure vs examples | few-shot transcripts, decision tree, JSON, bulleted, prose |
| 6 | **Voice** | imperative vs persona vs narrative | "you are a closer" vs "consider" vs no-voice direct rules |
| 7 | **Length** | minimalist vs verbose | 20 words vs 500 words vs 1500 words as explicit bookends |
| 8 | **Dynamics** | what to do after rejection, near deadline | concession curve, deadline pressure rule, overtime floor |

**Rule:** if fewer than ~6 of 8 axes have been touched with substantive changes, the loop is not plateaued. Propose on an untouched axis.

The taxonomy is for multi-turn agent prompts (negotiation, games, customer support, sales). For single-shot prompts (classification, extraction, generation) adapt to: task framing, input formatting, output schema, few-shot examples, voice, length, constraint wording, failure-mode coverage.

### Move 3 — Structured `cross-model-review` prompts

When revert mining and taxonomy coverage don't produce the next move, invoke `cross-model-review` skill — but not with "what should I do." Three prompts, in order:

**Prompt A — Pattern mining:**
> Here are my last 10 reverts with axis and failure-mode labels. What pattern connects them that I'm not seeing? What is the loop systematically missing?

**Prompt B — Coverage:**
> Here are the 8 axes of the search space and which I've touched with substantive changes. For each untouched axis, propose one substantive change to this specific problem. Rank them by expected value.

**Prompt C — Surface expansion:**
> The mutable surface is `<current surface>`. I've exhausted it. What would it mean to expand the surface, and which expansion has the highest expected value given my goal?

Pattern: **one cross-model-review call, three questions** (the expensive part is deliberation, not question count). Don't one-shot; follow up on whichever thread produces the most contrarian view.

**Escalation to `expert-panel`** if cross-model-review feedback shows disagreement across multiple angles that Codex alone can't resolve — the panel gives 3-5 domain perspectives.

### Move 4 — Radical-move catalog for LLM-prompt loops

When an untouched axis is identified, these moves consistently produce above-noise deltas (positive OR negative — both are useful signal). Each is one atomic change. Combine only after individually testing.

- **Inversion** — say what NOT to do instead of what to do. Often works where positive rules fail because the model treats negatives as harder constraints.
- **Few-shot examples** — paste 1-2 worked transcripts with no rules. Often a reliable win at frontier model sizes. **Small-model caveat (n=1):** flash-lite on a numeric negotiation prompt pattern-matched the illustrative numbers instead of generalizing the procedure and regressed by -0.048. Still worth trying on non-numeric or larger-model problems.
- **Format shift** — rewrite the current rules as JSON, a decision tree, or Q&A pairs. Same content, different shape, different compliance profile. **Small-model caveat (n=1):** on flash-lite with a flowing-prose winning baseline, Q&A decision-tree fragmentation regressed -0.044.
- **Data-targeted instruction** — read the failure log, identify the common failure mode, write a prompt that explicitly targets it.
- **Opponent / counterparty model** — instruct the agent on what the OTHER party probably wants/fears, let it derive strategy from that.
- **Length extremes** — test 20 words and 1500 words as bookends. If either beats the current ~500-word baseline, the length axis has slack.
- **Role forking** — explicit branches per role. Symmetric strategies leave role-specific value on the table in asymmetric problems.
- **Information-flow moves** — what gets said publicly is a first-class decision. Test: reveal partial preferences, reveal fake preferences, commit to silence, signal urgency, mirror the opponent's message style.

## Termination

Declare a genuine plateau only when ALL of these are true:

- [ ] All 8 axes (or adapted equivalents) touched with at least one substantive attempt
- [ ] Revert-pattern mining run, no untouched axis has clear expected value
- [ ] `cross-model-review` invoked with all three prompts (A, B, C) and the feedback applied
- [ ] Simplicity criterion checked — no deletion would be a free win (via negativa pass)
- [ ] Tradeoff reverts have been followed up with compensating moves on other axes

Until all boxes are checked, "plateau" is anti-pattern #13 in disguise. Go back to Move 1.
