# Triage checklist — is this problem autoresearch-shaped?

Score each dimension **green / yellow / red**. All green → pure optimizer. Any yellow → adapt the mode. Any red → adapt or refuse.

This is the highest-leverage stage in the whole skill. Most autoresearch failures are candidates that should have failed triage but were allowed through.

## 1. Feedback latency

How long from "make a change" to "know if it worked"?

- **Green** — minutes or hours. Examples: code benchmarks, token counts, bundle size, test pass rate, static analysis scores, ML model eval on held-out set.
- **Yellow** — hours to a day. Examples: content readability, LLM-judge scoring on large corpora, scraping pipelines with rate limits.
- **Red** — days, weeks, or months. Examples: sales response rates, product retention, compounding revenue, SEO rankings, customer NPS.

If red: human-in-loop or barbell mode. Pure optimization on red-latency signals converges on noise because the fitness function can't produce enough signal in the iteration window.

## 2. Metric mechanicality

Is the metric extractable by a command, or does a human need to judge it?

- **Green** — deterministic command outputs a number. Examples: `pytest --cov`, benchmark wall-clock, `wc`, held-out accuracy, token count, latency p99.
- **Yellow** — LLM judge with a rubric, fixed seed, and fixed corpus. Reproducible if seeded, but expensive and drifts with model updates. Acceptable if the rubric has been validated against human judgment.
- **Red** — subjective human quality. Not a fitness function.

If red: Stage 3 (fitness design) is where the real work lives. Either build a mechanical proxy or refuse the loop.

## 3. Tail shape

Is the payoff thin-tailed (small wins compound) or fat-tailed (one big hit dominates all other outcomes)?

- **Green** — thin-tailed, stationary. Examples: code performance, extraction accuracy, compression ratio, database query time.
- **Yellow** — mixed. Most gains are thin-tailed but tail events matter. Examples: landing page conversion, ad creative, retention funnels.
- **Red** — fat-tailed, reflexive. Examples: B2B enterprise sales, content virality, VC fundraising, creative breakthroughs.

If red: **barbell mode is mandatory**. Pure optimization on fat-tailed domains "trains a better turkey" (Taleb) — converges to a brittle local optimum that breaks when the environment shifts or adapts.

**Self-play note:** when the "opponent" or evaluator is the same LLM as the agent being optimized, behavior is mildly reflexive. Score tail shape as yellow even when the primary metric looks thin-tailed. Mitigations: hold the opponent's prompt strictly fixed across iterations, use a larger corpus, or switch to barbell with a locked minimalist core.

## 4. Sample size vs noise

For one fitness evaluation, how many independent samples contribute? Is that enough to distinguish a real delta from noise?

- **Green** — thousands of samples per eval. Differences are detectable at small effect sizes.
- **Yellow** — 50 to 500 samples. Power analysis needed.
- **Red** — fewer than 50 samples, or the sample is a single event (a deal, a launch, a campaign). The metric is a coin flip with narrative attached.

Sample size failure is the **#1 killer** in real autoresearch runs. Fix it before looping:
- Pool across archetypes or domains
- Use a fixed large corpus even if production runs on a small one
- Use synthetic data or model-based eval to multiply samples
- Run each fitness evaluation with multiple seeds and report the distribution

If you can't get above red, the problem isn't ready for the loop. Do not start it.

## 5. Surface locality

How local is a typical productive change?

- **Green** — atomic diffs. One file, one function, one parameter. Keep-or-revert works cleanly.
- **Yellow** — coordinated multi-file changes. Still revertable with git, but harder to reason about which change caused which delta.
- **Red** — architectural / system redesign. Not iteratable. Each change is a bet, not an experiment.

If red: this isn't a loop, it's a design decision. Use `expert-panel` skill or a PLAN phase, not autoresearch.

## The refusal template

When a candidate fails triage:

> This candidate isn't autoresearch-shaped because [dimension X is red: specific reason]. If I run the loop here, it will converge to a local optimum of the wrong thing — efficiently. Here's what to do instead:
>
> 1. [Specific alternative that addresses the blocker]
> 2. [A smaller, better-shaped sub-problem that IS autoresearch-shaped]
> 3. [Another mode that might work — barbell, via negativa, human-in-loop]
>
> Want me to look at one of these instead?

Refusing is the correct output. Do not start the loop to be agreeable.

## Override: force

If the user explicitly overrides a red verdict via `override: force` in `goal.md` with a mandatory reason, log BOTH the override AND the original triage verdict in `experiments/journal.md`. The loop runs, but the plateau diagnosis (Stage 6) carries forward the unresolved red dimension as the primary suspect.

The override is tracked so post-mortems can distinguish "pure optimizer on all-green candidate" from "forced loop on red-latency candidate that plateaued as predicted".

## Cross-dimension patterns

- **All red:** not a candidate. Use `expert-panel` or `systematic-debugging` (5-whys).
- **Latency + tail red, others green:** classic sales / content / marketing. Use barbell.
- **Metric red, others green:** build a mechanical proxy in Stage 3, or use LLM-judge with validated rubric.
- **Samples red, others green:** grow the corpus (pool, synthetic, historical) before looping.
- **Surface red, others green:** use via negativa on subcomponents instead of redesigning the whole.
- **One yellow, rest green:** proceed with the caution noted in `references/modes.md`.
