# Goal: [one-line statement]

**Owner:** [name]
**Started:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Mode:** [pure / barbell / via-negativa / inverted / human-in-loop]
**Triage verdict:** [all-green / yellow in X / red in X, adapted with mode Y]

---

## Goal

[What should be better after this runs? State as "before → after" with numbers where possible.]

- Before: [current state]
- After: [desired state]
- Why it matters: [the real outcome this supports — not the metric, the outcome]

---

## Mutable surface

What files, prompts, config, copy, or parameters can the agent change? Be specific — paths or patterns, not categories.

**Read-only (must not touch):**
- [path or rule]
- [path or rule]

**Mutable (agent may modify):**
- [path or rule]
- [path or rule]

**If barbell mode:** the mutable surface above is the 10-15% experimental zone. The proven baseline is in:
- [path or rule]

---

## Fitness function

**Command:** `[the shell command or script that outputs a number]`

**Direction:** `higher` | `lower` is better

**Corpus:** [what the fitness is computed on — must be fixed and seeded]
- Path: [path to corpus]
- Size: [N examples]
- Seed: [integer]

**Baseline:** [the number before any iteration, date recorded]

**Significance threshold:** [delta below this is noise — measured from 5 repeat runs of the fitness function on the baseline]

**Sanity check:**
- Known-good examples scored: [list, with scores]
- Known-bad examples scored: [list, with scores]
- Metric agrees with ground truth: [yes / no — if no, DO NOT START THE LOOP]

---

## Guard metrics

What must not regress. At least one guard is required.

- **[Guard 1 name]:** must stay [above / below] [threshold]. Measured by: `[command]`
- **[Guard 2 name]:** must stay [above / below] [threshold]. Measured by: `[command]`

If any guard fails, automatic revert regardless of the primary metric.

---

## Budget

- Iterations: [N]
- Wall-clock: [T hours]
- Dollars: [$X]

The loop terminates when any budget is exhausted, a plateau is detected (default: 10 iterations with no improvement above the significance threshold), or a guard is violated without a recoverable revert.

---

## Stop conditions beyond budget

- [any domain-specific rule — e.g., "stop if proposal quality degrades," "stop if reviewer approval rate drops below 50%"]

---

## Notes

Prior attempts, known bad directions, things that have already been tried, things the agent should NOT propose:

- [note]
- [note]

## Triage record

Walked through `references/triage-checklist.md` on [date]:

| Dimension | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Feedback latency | G/Y/R | |
| Metric mechanicality | G/Y/R | |
| Tail shape | G/Y/R | |
| Sample size | G/Y/R | |
| Surface locality | G/Y/R | |

**Verdict:** [pure / barbell / via-negativa / inverted / human-in-loop / refused]

### override: force (optional)

Set ONLY if the user explicitly overrides a red verdict. Mandatory reason required.

- `override: force`: [no | yes]
- Reason: [explain why the loop runs despite a red dimension — cite specific justification]
- Risk accepted: [which red dimension's failure mode is being accepted]

When override is set, the plateau diagnosis (Stage 6) will carry this as the primary suspect for any non-convergence.

## Fitness design record

Walked through `references/fitness-design.md` on [date]. The seven requirements:

- [ ] Callable as a command (Req #1)
- [ ] Fixed corpus with fixed seeds (Req #2)
- [ ] Baseline recorded in `baseline.json` (Req #3)
- [ ] Significance threshold defined (Req #4)
- [ ] Sanity check done (known-good and known-bad agree with metric) (Req #5)
- [ ] Guard metrics defined (Req #6)
- [ ] (LLM-prompt loops) Compliance audit: ≥70% on baseline traces (Req #7) — N/A if not an LLM-prompt loop

All requirements must be checked before the loop starts.
