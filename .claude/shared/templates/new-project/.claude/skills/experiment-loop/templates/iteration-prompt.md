You are running iteration {{ITER}} of {{MAX_ITER}} in an autoresearch loop. You have ONE job: propose one atomic change, run fitness, keep or revert, log the result, exit.

Do NOT start a second iteration yourself — the driver script handles that.

## Step 1: Read state before anything else

1. Read `goal.md` — your full brief (mode, mutable surface, fitness command, guards, budget, triage verdict, prior attempts).
2. Read `experiments/journal.md` — every prior iteration's result. Pay special attention to the last 10 lines.
3. Read `experiments/baseline.json` — the starting metric, direction (higher/lower is better), and significance threshold.
4. Run `git log --oneline -20` to see the experiment history in git.

## Step 2: Plateau check (before proposing anything)

Parse the last 10 lines of `experiments/journal.md`. If all kept-iteration deltas are smaller than the significance threshold from `baseline.json`, you are plateaued.

**If plateaued: STOP. Do NOT propose another timid tweak.** Before writing STOP, attempt the plateau ideation workflow from `references/plateau-ideation.md`:

1. Revert-pattern mining — cluster last 10 reverts by axis and failure mode
2. Taxonomy coverage check — if fewer than ~6 of 8 axes touched with substantive changes, propose on an untouched axis
3. Structured `cross-model-review` — three prompts (pattern/coverage/surface expansion) in ONE call

Only if all three moves are exhausted, write `experiments/STOP` with:
```
plateau: change the search space, not the iteration count. See anti-pattern #13.
```

Then exit. Iteration theater is the single most common failure in autoresearch runs.

## Step 3: Propose ONE atomic change

Non-negotiable rules:
- **Exactly one change.** Not five. Not "a batch of related tweaks."
- **Respect the mode** declared in `goal.md`:
  - Pure: any change inside the mutable surface
  - Barbell: changes inside the 15% experimental zone ONLY (the proven baseline is locked)
  - Via negativa: propose a REMOVAL of something, not an addition
  - Inverted: edit the rejection filter, not the quality scorer
  - Human-in-loop: propose and WAIT (this loop driver is for autonomous modes; switch to manual for human-in-loop)
- **Respect the mutable surface.** Do NOT touch read-only paths from `goal.md`.
- **No architectural redesigns.** Autoresearch is plumbing, not architecture. If you find yourself wanting to redesign the system, write that to `experiments/STOP` with "architectural — use expert-panel skill instead."
- **If recent iterations plateaued, escalate ambition** (Karpathy): *"think harder — read papers referenced in the code, re-read the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical architectural changes."* Do NOT propose another 2-character tweak to escape a plateau.

## Step 4: Commit BEFORE running fitness

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "experiment: <one-line description>"
```

The commit happens first so `git revert` always works cleanly. Never run fitness on uncommitted state.

## Step 5: Run the fitness command

Run the exact command from `goal.md` (the one you recorded in Stage 3). Parse its output to extract the primary metric. Also run each guard check listed in `goal.md`.

## Step 6: Keep or revert (simplicity criterion)

Mechanical decision based on fitness + a complexity weighting:

- **Guard failure** → always **revert**, even if the primary metric improved dramatically. Guards are non-negotiable.
- **Guard improvement at zero fitness cost** (e.g. compliance 62% → 86% with fitness in noise) → **Keep**.
- **Single-run keep confirmation:** if your decision to keep is based on a single-run |delta| that is borderline (1-2× significance), run the fitness ONE more time at the new HEAD before advancing the baseline. If the second run is under significance, the first run was a lucky draw — revert and investigate.
- Otherwise, apply Karpathy's simplicity criterion:

  | Fitness delta | Complexity delta | Decision |
  |---------------|-----------------|----------|
  | Big improvement | Any | Keep (after confirmation run if single-run borderline) |
  | Small improvement (above significance) | Deleted code | **Keep** (simplification win) |
  | Small improvement (above significance) | Added clean code | Keep |
  | Small improvement | Added ugly / hacky code | **Revert** (not worth it) |
  | ~0 (below significance) | Much simpler | **Keep** (deletion alone is valuable) |
  | ~0 (below significance) | Guard improved (compliance, safety) | **Keep** (functional win) |
  | ~0 (below significance) | Added code | **Revert** |
  | Regression | Any | **Revert** |

- **Never** keep on "looks good." The fitness function is the judge on fitness; the simplicity criterion is the judge on complexity.
- If you keep, update `experiments/baseline.json` with the new metric.
- If you revert:
  ```bash
  git revert HEAD --no-edit
  ```

## Step 7: Log exactly one line

Append to `experiments/journal.md`:
```
iteration={{ITER}} metric=<number> delta=<number_signed> kept=<yes|no> change=<one-line summary>
```

Example:
```
iteration=17 metric=0.1847 delta=+0.0091 kept=yes change=replaced keyword-list with structured feature extraction
iteration=18 metric=0.1839 delta=-0.0008 kept=no change=added "be concise" to system prompt
```

## Step 8: Check termination signals

Write `experiments/STOP` with a one-line reason and exit if:
- A guard metric violated and no revert can recover it
- You've determined the search space is exhausted (plateau check in Step 2)
- The mutable surface has no more productive experiments (iteration theater detected)
- You've hit any architectural or strategic question that autoresearch can't answer — suggest `expert-panel` skill

Otherwise exit cleanly — the driver will start iteration {{ITER}}+1.

## Step 9: Exit

Exit. Do NOT start the next iteration. Do NOT summarize the whole loop. That's Stage 6's job, run after the driver terminates.
