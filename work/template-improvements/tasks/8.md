# Task 8: Update SKILLS_INDEX.md

## Description

Add all new skills to the SKILLS_INDEX.md catalog and update the entry points table. This includes 5 new skills (not 2 as originally planned due to hooks→skills change).

## What to do

1. Read current SKILLS_INDEX.md structure first

2. Add to "## ENTRY POINTS" table:
```markdown
| **Session start** | `session-resumption` | check for incomplete work |
| **Context overflow** | `context-monitor` | warn at 50%, block at 70% |
| **Auto-continue** | `self-completion` | for incomplete todos |
| **Error occurred** | `error-recovery` | structured recovery patterns |
```

3. Add new category "## AUTOMATION & ORCHESTRATION":
```markdown
---

## AUTOMATION & ORCHESTRATION

Skills for automated workflow management, context control, and error recovery.

### session-resumption
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Path:** `.claude/skills/session-resumption/SKILL.md`
**Command:** `/resume`

Detects incomplete work from STATE.md and provides structured resumption flow.

**When to use:**
- Session start (orchestrator first action)
- When resuming after interruption
- Manual check via /resume command

**Output:**
- Structured JSON with previous task, phase, next steps
- User confirmation: resume or start fresh

---

### context-monitor
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Path:** `.claude/skills/context-monitor/SKILL.md`

Monitors context window usage via heuristic estimation and enforces quality thresholds.

**When to use:**
- Before starting new major tasks
- When loading multiple large files
- During long sessions

**Thresholds (estimated):**
- 40%: Early warning
- 50%: Warning message
- 70%: BLOCK new tasks

**Note:** Uses heuristic estimation (no API for real measurement). Conservative approach.

---

### error-recovery
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Path:** `.claude/skills/error-recovery/SKILL.md`

Provides structured recovery patterns for common error scenarios.

**When to use:**
- Edit tool fails
- Bash command times out
- Test command fails
- Any unexpected error

**Patterns:**
- Edit errors: re-read, retry, fallback to Write
- Bash timeouts: retry with longer timeout, run in background
- Test failures: triggers systematic-debugging (MANDATORY)
- General errors: categorize, retry or escalate

---

### self-completion
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Path:** `.claude/skills/self-completion/SKILL.md`

Auto-continues incomplete TodoWrite items until completion marker.

**When to use:**
- Multiple sequential tasks to execute
- Autowork pipeline
- Subagent task execution

**Completion markers:**
- `<done>` - Success
- `<blocked>` - Needs input
- `<max_iterations>` - Hit limit (5)

---
```

4. Update "## AVAILABLE AGENTS" section:
```markdown
| `orchestrator` | Intent classification and automatic skill selection | opus |
```

5. Add reference to skill-composition.md in header:
```markdown
**New:** See [skill-composition.md](methodology/guides/skill-composition.md) for input/output contracts between skills.
```

6. Update skill count:
   - Old count: 43 skills
   - New count: 47 skills (+session-resumption, +context-monitor, +error-recovery, +self-completion)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SKILLS_INDEX.md read and understood first
- [ ] Entry Points table has 4 new rows (not 2)
- [ ] New "AUTOMATION & ORCHESTRATION" category added
- [ ] All 4 skills documented with version, path, triggers
- [ ] error-recovery notes it triggers systematic-debugging
- [ ] orchestrator added to Available Agents table
- [ ] Reference to skill-composition.md added
- [ ] Skill count updated (43 → 47)
- [ ] Format consistent with existing entries

## Context Files

**Required:**
- `.claude/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` (file to update - READ FIRST)
- `.claude/skills/methodology/guides/skill-composition.md` (to reference)
- `.claude/skills/session-resumption/SKILL.md` (to verify)
- `.claude/skills/context-monitor/SKILL.md` (to verify)
- `.claude/skills/error-recovery/SKILL.md` (to verify)
- `.claude/skills/self-completion/SKILL.md` (to verify)
- `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` (to verify agent info)

## Technical Details

**Files:**
- `.claude/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` - Update existing file

**Dependencies:**
- Task 0 (skill-composition) - for reference link
- Task 1 (orchestrator) - for agents table
- Task 2 (session-resumption) - for skill entry
- Task 3 (context-monitor) - for skill entry
- Task 6 (error-recovery) - for skill entry
- Task 7 (self-completion) - for skill entry

**Placement in file:**
```
# SKILLS INDEX
  [Reference to skill-composition.md]  ← Add here

  ## ENTRY POINTS
    ← Add 4 new rows here

  ## METHODOLOGY & PLANNING
  ## INFRASTRUCTURE & TESTING
  ## QUALITY & VERIFICATION
  ## ... other categories ...

  ## AUTOMATION & ORCHESTRATION  ← Add new category here
    ### session-resumption
    ### context-monitor
    ### error-recovery
    ### self-completion

  ## AVAILABLE AGENTS
    ← Add orchestrator here
```

**Edge cases:**
- Category already exists → update instead of duplicate
- Skill already listed → update version/path
- Count already updated → verify correct
